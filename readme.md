This Project is a 9 keys macro-keyboard for devolopers

# The aim of the Project is -
  1. to build good quality keyboard Under 800
  2. Add features like Sound detection , USB hub etc.
  3. Make them easy to Proggram .

# PROJECT TIMELINE -- 
  
  1. 28-05-2022 : Completed with the base design of the keyboard , Having 9 cherry mx keys w/Led . it also has other features -- a roatary Encoder
                 A OLED deisplay , A usb Hub , A audio jack . The system is controlled using STM32(F103C8Tx)
  2. 02-06-2022 : Complete Schematic of new PCB with RP2040 (since its cheap and high quality microcontroller).
                 
    # The Budget is not finalized yet but as per my rough calculations I will  spen 40% - 50% in the Case and plate manufacture and 25 % on PCB and 25 % on extra components

#MADE BY - BOB_THE_OG
# I am also trying to make a Wireless version of it , will update soon once its done.
